            Possible Mutations:
            Byte Shift: A field that has any range outside of the HEADER is changed by Â±1.
            Insertion: Inserts a randomized conditional chunk at the end of the MOVE chunk.
            Deletion: Removes a conditional chunk at the end of the MOVE chunk.

            All three mutation types have separate mutation rates - probabilities that they will happen.

            Conditional Formats:
            0: Condition 1
            1: Condition 1 && Condition 2
            2: Condition 1 || Condition 2

            Comparison Operators
            0: ==
            1: !=
            2: >
            3: <

            Environment Variables:
